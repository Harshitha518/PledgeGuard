# PledgeGuard
Combatting child marriage with community-powered anonymous reporting.

---

## Problem & Inspiration
Currently, 1 in 5 young women are married before they are 18 years old. The rate of child marriages is even higher in underserved communities where intervention often comes too late. These cases are also rarely reported — not because people don’t care, but because they feel powerless or unsafe speaking out.

As a teenage girl passionate about gender equality and innovating technology for positive change, I wanted to build a tool that puts power in the hands of everyday people — empowering them to speak up anonymously, pledge support, and intervene early. PledgeGuard turns silence into action. When scaled and grown, PledgeGuard is a simple but powerful tool with real potential to protect girls, build community accountability, and advance the global movement to end child marriage.
